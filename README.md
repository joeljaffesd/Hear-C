# Hear-C: A Browser-Based Development Environment for C++ Audio
Hear-C is a browser-based IDE (integrated development environment) for writing digital audio synthesis and effects programs in C++. For those learning to code, browser-based IDEs simplify the development process by removing the requirement to set up developer tools locally, a task that varies by operating system and can be daunting for a beginner. While browser-based IDEs exist for a number of audio-specific languages such as Faust and ChucK, there is no major web app providing this functionality for C++, the lingua-franca of digital audio.
